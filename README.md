# HydrationCPP

Have you ever noticed that you do not drink enough water? If so, you're not alone! In modern society, our lives are filled with busy schedules, that we have trouble finding time to drink water. Any medical professional would tell you that we need at least 8 cups of water per day. Now, imagine you had an app downloaded on your phone that sends you a notification every time you need to drink more water, and when you reach the recommended amount, you stop receiving notifications! Here I have coded two C++ programs that work in a similar manner. The iterative approach loops through the amount of cups of water, and until you reach 8 cups of water, it will notify you to drink more. On the other hand, the recursive approach involves the drink() function being called within itself. Both programs perform the same effect. Enjoy and happy coding!
